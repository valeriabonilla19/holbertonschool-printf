# _printf
Write a function that prints formatted and non formatted text and numerical output.

# Description
\_printf is a custom implementation of the C std library printf. Our goal is to 
replicate printf's functionality. This implementation supports some of the features of
printf, including formatting of strings and numbers as well as the ability to print to 
standard output and files.

# Usage
To use the \_printf function, you need to include the main.h header file in your c 
program and call the function as follows:

\_printf(format, (arguments)...);

# Features
\_printf supports the following specifiers:

- %c: Prints a single character
- %s: Prints a string of characters
- %d: Prints an integer
- %i: Prints an integer
